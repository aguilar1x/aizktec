# Aizktec

Welcome to **Aizktec!** This repository is the heart of our innovative project that aims to blend cutting-edge **blockchain technologies** with an intuitive **web app** experience.  

Our vision is to create a **decentralized platform** that leverages:
- **Smart contracts** for secure and automated transactions.  
- **Advanced UTXO models** to enhance scalability and privacy.  
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for maintaining security and user confidentiality.  

All of this is seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly **Next.js web interface**.

## **The Web Interface**

The **Aizktec** web app is built using:  

- **Next.js** â€“ A powerful React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.  
- **Bun** â€“ A modern, fast package manager and JavaScript runtime.  
- **ShadCN Components** â€“ A collection of beautifully designed UI elements for a seamless user experience.  

This is where the **graphical side** of our blockchain-powered platform comes to life.
